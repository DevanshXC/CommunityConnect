## About
CommunityConnect is designed to make it easy for local communities and interest groups to post events, share resources, and maintain discussions. It aims to be simple to deploy and extend.

## Features
- User sign-up and profile management
- Event creation, RSVP, and calendar integration
- Resource library with tagging and search
- Discussion threads / comments for each event or resource
- Admin dashboard for moderation and analytics

(Adjust features to match the actual project functionality.)

## Tech Stack
- Frontend: (e.g., React, Vue, plain HTML)
- Backend: (e.g., Node.js / Express, Django, Flask)
- Database: (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB)
- Authentication: (e.g., JWT, OAuth)
- Deployment: (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, Docker + Kubernetes)

## Getting Started

Prerequisites
- Node.js >= 16.x and npm or yarn (if using Node)
- Docker (optional, for containerized setup)
- A database (Postgres / MongoDB) or instructions for an embedded/dev DB

Installation (example for Node.js)
1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/DevanshXC/CommunityConnect.git
2. Change directory:
   cd CommunityConnect
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   or
   yarn install

Development (local)
1. Create a .env file from .env.example:
   cp .env.example .env
2. Set your environment variables (DB connection, JWT secret, etc.)
3. Run migrations / seed (if applicable)
4. Start dev server:
   npm run dev
   or
   yarn dev

Docker (optional)
- Build and run:
  docker compose up --build

## Configuration
Create a .env file with values for:
- DATABASE_URL
- JWT_SECRET
- NODE_ENV
- PORT
- Any third-party API keys (Google Calendar, email provider, etc.)

Provide a .env.example in the repo so contributors can easily populate local configs.

## Usage
- Start the app (production):
  npm start
  or
  yarn start

- Example API endpoints (replace with actual routes)
  - GET /api/events — list events
  - POST /api/events — create event (auth required)
  - POST /api/auth/signup — create account

Add example requests (curl/postman) and screenshots here to make onboarding easier.

## Testing
- Run unit tests:
  npm test
  or
  yarn test

- Run linting / formatting:
  npm run lint
  npm run format

## Development
- Branching strategy: use `main` for production-ready code and `develop` for ongoing work (optional)
- Follow consistent code style (ESLint / Prettier recommended)
- Add tests for new features; write clear commit messages
